## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a first-year PhD student in the Siebel School of Computing and Data Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign
(UIUC). I am "watched" by my advisor <a href="https://tianyin.github.io/">Tianyin Xu</a>.
<br />
<br />
My research explores practical AI and agent techniques for
safety-critical computer systems and infrastructures. 
My current work is in the AIOps space, specifically in AI for Site Reliability Engineering (SRE).
I'm currently collaborating with Microsoft Research and IBM Research to build LLM benchmarks and agents for SRE (<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/AIOpsLab/">AIOpsLab</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05352">IT-Bench</a>).
<br />
<br />
In the past, I worked at NASA in the Space Technology Mission Directorate, where
I helped develop space systems for the International Space Station. 
I'm also an instructor at the Discovery Partners Institute at the
University of Illinois, where I teach a professional development class on Data Science to CPS high school teachers.
